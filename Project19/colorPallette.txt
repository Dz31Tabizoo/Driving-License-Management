Implementation Tips
Maintain contrast - Use white space generously to keep the interface light and professional

Consistency - Apply colors consistently across all components

Accessibility - Ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds (white text on navy blue works well)

Hierarchy - Use the navy blue (#284b63) to draw attention to important elements

Balance - Use the light gray (#d9d9d9) to create visual separation without heavy borders

This color scheme will give your app a professional, clean appearance that isn't too dark, with the navy blue and light gray providing a modern, balanced look.
